Walking on Sunshine's SG Walking Trails Explorer App

Singapore is an eminenty walkable city with trails catering to the needs of different groups of people! Unfortuately there is no common collection of trails that are categorized, that people can browse through.

Walking on Sunshine, made up of myself and Daryl Tew, hope to bridge this gap by creating a simple yet usable app that allows people to explore Singapore in the way we feel is best - on their feet :)

(P.S. we are newcomers to coding and software development so this is also a learning journey for us too.)
